# Dell BIOS Automation Script with PowerShell

#### This PowerShell script automates the deployment of Dell BIOS settings across a list of target machines using Dell's CCTK (Client Configuration Toolkit) and PsExec.

### What It Does

Uses a pre-configured BIOS settings executable (created via Dell's CCTK GUI)
Pushes that executable and related files to remote machines
Triggers the BIOS update silently using PsExec
Collects logs from each target machine
Cleans up all copied files
Reboots each machine after applying BIOS settings

 ### Requirements

- Dell CCTK (Client Configuration Toolkit): Download from Dell‚Äôs official site.
- PsExec: Part of Sysinternals Suite.
- A working batch file that runs the BIOS update (generated by CCTK GUI).
- A machine where the BIOS settings were configured and exported using CCTK.
- Admin rights and remote access to target machines (e.g. C$ shares and PsExec access).

### Folder & File Setup

- Use CCTK GUI on a machine with the right BIOS settings.
- Export the desired BIOS settings into an executable.
- CCTK will also create a folder with additional files next to the .exe (keep this intact).

Prepare:
- A batch file that runs the .exe.
- The directory containing the .exe and its dependencies.
- A computer list in .txt format (e.g. computers.txt).


###ÔøΩ Variables You Must Set in the Script

Edit the following variables at the top of the script:

$iniPath      = "[Path to your .ini file]"
$psExecPath   = "C:\PSTools\PsExec.exe"
$batchSource  = "[Directory with your .bat file (can be network path)]"
$biosSource   = "[Directory with your CCTK files (can be network path)]"
$batchFile    = "[Your batch filename, e.g., BIOS_BATCH_V2.bat]"

### How It Works

1. Reads INI File ‚Üí Gets path to computers.txt
2. Parses List ‚Üí Loops through each computer
3. Copies Files ‚Üí Copies BIOS folder + batch to C:\Temp\ on each machine
4. Triggers Update ‚Üí Uses PsExec to silently run the batch remotely
5. Collects Logs ‚Üí Pulls BIOSFLASHLOGS.txt from each machine to a master log
6. Cleans Up ‚Üí Deletes batch file and BIOS folder on the target
7. Reboots Machines ‚Üí Performs a forced reboot on each system

### üìÅ Example Folder Layout

\\Share\BIOS\
‚îÇ   BIOS_Settings.exe
‚îÇ   other-cctk-files...
\\Share\Scripts\
‚îÇ   BIOS_BATCH_V2.bat

## Notes

Make sure your user has admin rights on all target machines.
PsExec must be allowed through firewall and antivirus on both ends.
Logs are collected into a master log file‚Äîmake sure to set the $masterLog path in your script if needed.
Don't forget to test on a small group of non-critical machines first.

# Automation Use Case

 ## This script is great for:

- Applying BIOS lockdown policies in a lab
- Setting password/enabling TPM/Secure Boot in bulk
- Saving hours of manual CCTK execution per machine
